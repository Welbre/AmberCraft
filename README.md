Real electricity simulation minecraft mod.

![alt text](/resources/AmberCraftWallPaper.png)

At the moment the mod is development to **minecraft 1.21.4**, but will be update to new versions.

#### Central ideas
* Simulate resistors, capacitors, indutores, diodes, and transistors in game.
* Simulate basics thermodynamics laws in game.
* To be survival-friendly.
* To be very modular, with many different options to do the same work.
* Don't have all in one machines[^1].
* No TIERS, all machines or material have positives and negatives, this isn't an unbreakable rule!


[^1]: Machines that can do multiple functions in a single block without punishing the player in any way.
